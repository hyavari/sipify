# Sipify

Sipify is a SIP parser module for Node.js.

This module utilizes the Grammar from the [SIP.js](https://github.com/onsip/sip.js/) project. Notably, the grammar has been enhanced to accommodate additional SIP headers crucial for IMS services. If you're engaged in implementing IMS systems with a microservices approach, this module simplifies working with SIP messages, offering enhanced support and ease of integration.

## Installation

npm install sipify
